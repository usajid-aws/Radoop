###  OVERVIEW
---

A Reddit Analyzer that shows the value of any given Reddit post. This 'value' is given by the number Upvotes + Downvotes + comments
on each post. The data used for this project was the work of researchers Lakkarajue et al. For their data set, they collected information
on reposts of images as it was significantly easy to identify reposted images using reverse image search.
Using the data set, they were able to derive models on how time, social context, and presentation affected
a postâ€™s performance, ultimately helping them understand when, where, and how a post should be
presented to maximize its reach.
